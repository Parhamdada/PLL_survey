# PLL_survey
A repository of most recent published PLLs, with comparison graphs. \
For example the following graph is comparing fractional PLLs based on their FOM and worst fractional spur level highlighting differences in area, oscillator type, and PLL type. (The highlighted point is just an example to show how you can compare your design agains other references.)
